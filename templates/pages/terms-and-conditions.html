                        Before booking a table, carefully review your event type choices. Refund and exchange policies
                        are generally set forth by the event Organizers who generally prohibit Night Plan Kenya, Inc.
                        from
                        issuing exchanges or refunds after a ticket has been purchased. You agree that you will not

                        you purchased. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you will not contact Party
                        Kenya, Inc. to seek a refund or exchange from Night Plan Kenya, Inc. when Night Plan Kenya, Inc.
                        is
                        prohibited from providing one by its Organizers, and you will not dispute or otherwise seek a
                        "chargeback" from the company whose credit card you used to book a table at the club or event.
                        Should you do so, table preservation may be canceled, and Night Plan Kenya, Inc. may, in its
                        sole
                        discretion, refuse to honor pending and future table bookings made from all credit card
                        accounts or online accounts on which such chargebacks have been made, and may prohibit all
                        persons in whose name the credit card accounts exist and any person who accesses any associated
                        online account or credit card or who otherwise breaches this provision from using the Site.
                        Night Plan Kenya, Inc. typically only offers refunds and/or exchanges based on the Organizer’s
                        instructions. Night Plan Kenya, Inc. is not obligated to issue a refund except to the extent
                        that
                        the Organizer responsible for bringing you the event (1) provides Night Plan Kenya, Inc. with
                        the
                        table booking funds necessary to issue refunds. In order to receive a refund or an exchange
                        that may be offered, you will have to comply with the Organizer’s instructions or deadlines,
                        which, along with the decision about whether or not to issue a refund or an exchange, may be at
                        the Organizer’s discretion.
                        If Night Plan Kenya, Inc. issues you a refund for a table bookings, it will issue a refund of
                        the
                        face value paid (or, if a discounted value, then instead the discounted value price paid). In
                        no event will Fees or delivery prices or amounts be refunded under any circumstance. If a
                        refund is issued, it will be issued using the same method of payment that was used to book the
                        tables. If a credit card was used to make the refunded purchase, then only that actual credit
                        card will receive the credit for the refund.
                        In general, sales are final and Party Kneya Inc. and/or it’s Organizers will not issue refunds,
                        unless the event is cancelled or rescheduled or the facility is closed due to unforeseen
                        circumstances. If the event is canceled or rescheduled you may receive a refund or exchange
                        based on the Organizers instructions. To request a refund you must contact Night Plan Kenya,
                        Inc.
                        with your table number, name, event name and contact info at nightplankenya@gmail.com. Again,
                        under no circumstances is the service charge ever refunded even if an event is cancelled or
                        rescheduled.
